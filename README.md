# PCA Analysis Project
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a dataset using Python. It includes loading data, preprocessing, applying PCA, visualizing results, and analyzing reconstruction errors. The code also helps to identify optimal dimensions based on user-defined thresholds for data loss and explained variance.
# Usage
1.Load your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in CSV format.      
2.Update the file path: Modify the file_path variable in the code to point to your dataset.
3.Run the script: Execute the script to perform PCA on your data and visualize the results.
# Customization
You can customize the script by changing the thresholds for reconstruction error and the file path to your dataset. Modify the file_path variable and update the thresholds as needed for data loss and explained variance.
